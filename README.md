My Entry for Metroidvania Month 7 on itch.io

## Story
You play as a robot that has gained sentience and wants to escape the lab.  
The scientists want to stop you, but you can collect their experiments to help
you escape.

## About
This is a Metroidvania game that I want to feel a bit like Super Metroid for
the Super Nintendo.  I'll be trying a few things out that I've never done
before: multiple levels, save files, and cut scenes to name a few.  I hope
I can finish this game on time for [Metroidvania Month 7](https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-7).
